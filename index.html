                <h2>Year Zero</h2>
                <h3>A sad time with no dogs</h3>
                <p>It's hard for me to remember it at this point, but there was a time where I didn't have a dog. Therefore, there was a time where not all my conversations and motivations revolved around my puppy and making him happy. I'm not really sure what I talked about with people or how I made new friends that weren't also &#39;dog parents&#39;. I'm sure I was even more self-involved and had a bit more free time on my hands. That sounds nice, at first, but I now know how much more fulfilling life feels with such a great companion like <b>Captain Dog</b>.</p>

                <p>But Captain Dog (&#39;Captain&#39; for short) was nowhere near my radar as recently as 2015. Little did I know that the group of friends my girlfriend and I surround ourselves with were about to usher in a new chapter of dog ownership for both their lives and mine. Within the first half of 2016, my girlfriend's closest friends each picked up their first puppies.</p>

                <h2>Year One</h2>
                <h3>And suddenly, I had a dog</h3>
                <p>It wasn't long before my girlfriend and I came down with puppy fever. We knew we wanted to adopt a puppy and go through the process of raising and training a dog together. The only other significant stipulation was that the future puppy had to be so, <em>so</em> cute.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>My girlfriend had been researching adoption sites for weeks before she asked me to stop by a Petco on the way back from a morning hike. In that moment, I felt there was a 50/50 chance I was going home with a puppy that day. However, that percentage skyrocketed upon meeting Captain an hour later - made all the more evident by how I fended off a few youngsters that wanted to play with him.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Captain was a pretty different dog his in first few years. Obviously he looked considerably different as a puppy. His tail was skinny and pointy instead of fluffy. His nose was shorter and his mask was more densely populated with black fur. He had some gnarly eyebrows and his ears lied flat against his head. And of course with Captain being a mix, I wasn't sure how much he'd end up looking like a shepherd or something else entirely.</p>

                <h2>Year Two</h2>
                <h3>And twice the size</h3>
                <p>I love looking back at the pictures of Captain from his first couple of years of puppyhood. You can see how his ears slowly started to stand up, albeit each at their own pace. My girlfriend and I would make noises at him from opposite sides of his head to induce a head turn, which would also make his ears flop up and over each time he tilted in the direction of our respective noises.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Not only did Captain's ears start to stand taller, his torso grew longer. He was so lean and long, all the way down to his tail which lengthened before it widened and fluffed up.</p>
                <p>His patience for affection was short, however. Captain was a far more aloof and independent puppy. He would snip when you tried to kiss his face, and he generally preferred to lie down in a different room, or at least not share the couch with anyone. I reflect on his former behavior and appreciate the way he expresses his love for his mom and dad now. I'm projecting, but it almost feels like I earned his love and this relationship we share today.</p>

                <h2>Year Three</h2>
                <h3>Uh oh - he's as strong as me</h3>
                <p>I'd say Captain's current form really started to take shape in year three. He bulked up, which meant he was much stronger than before. He also knew how to test his parents' patience by more carefully choosing when to be stubborn.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Captain's mother and I had a hard time training Captain to behave properly on his walks. He had become so strong and he knew it. He was determined to dictate the path of every walk. My girlfriend and I tried several tools and methods, which unfortunately led us to using a gentle-lead. Captain hated the gentle-lead. It was itchy and it frequently slid down his snoot and pressed up against the base of his eyes. I suspect it also put some strain on his neck. Fortunately, a new solution to Captain's pulling problem arrived in 2019 in the form of more training and a properly utilized prong collar.</p>

                <h2>Year Four</h2>
                <h3>New training and new friends</h3>
                <p>Captain (and his parents) received additional training in 2019 through a personal trainer at his daycare, the Watering Bowl. Captain took to his trainer immediately. He loved the small tasks and challenges almost as much as he loved the rewards. Captain's training sessions were a mental and physical workout, while also resulting in a feast on treats for an hour! As a result, he's always game for a training session, and his behavior has improved considerably in recent years.</p>
                <p>Still, because of Captain's size, the way he used to yank on a leash, and because of how protective he is over his owners, Captain still inimidated other dogs and people on our walks. We struggled with neighbors steering away from Captain or not letting their dogs play with him.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Our neighbors hesitancy around Captain was frustrating, because his mother and I know Captain to be sweet, loyal, and playful. Fortunately, my girlfriend and I eventually met a neighbor with a beautiful shepherd-mix named Atlas. Atlas and Captain turned out to be a perfect pair as they have similar energy, size, and play styles. I doubt I've seen Captain happier around another dog.</p>

                <h3>Captain's life in a pandemic</h3>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced Captain's parents into the home 24/7, and it's clearly had an impact on him. Captain has become a little more dependent on his parents, and he's a little more anxious when one leaves the apartments.</p>
                <p>But the &#39;silver lining&#39; comes in the form of candid moments. My girlfriend and I knew he slept all day, but we didn't quite realize just how cute he is while he does it.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>My phone is bogged down by hundreds of pictures from the last 10 months - almost all of which feature Captain sleeping. Sometimes Captain sleeps on my pillows (despite my objections), and other times I catch him taking a nap with his sister - my girlfriend's pet bird, Kevin.</p>

                <p>To this date, the best part of 2020 is going through all of these pictures and videos of my favorite big-little guy. It reminds me of the opportunities to connect more and spend more time with my dog in 2020. It also means I'm around and ready to capture cute videos like Captain howling at sirens in the distance.</p>

                <p>It's been a hard year and one that many of us would like to forget. Still, I hope I never forget the time spent building an even stronger bond with my best friend, Captain Dog.</p>
